Clicking in the button in the login page for inserting the test data three username are inserted in the database:
  1)username:matteo,password:prova
  2)username:cia, password:dalla
  3)username:ale, password:dama
  Also there are inserted some outgoins for the user matteo, related to the other two users.

Operating rules:
1)for inserting an aoutgoing that the users pays shared with other users have to insert the outgoing indicating in the Total Cost label the total cost, in the users label he needs to intert the users with
 he wants to divide the cost in this format:user1,user2(basically the name of the users saperated by ,). The same occures for the quotes.
 2)for inserting an outgoing that the user logged hasn`t paid but he needs to give some money to another users the procedure is the same before but the total cost label inserted has to be indicated as 0(zero),
  the same is for an reimbursement.
